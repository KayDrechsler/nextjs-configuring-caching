# NextJSkk - Configuring Caching
A NextJS case study application where I tested several NextJS caching methods to assure updating data. The project allowed me some insight on how NextJS optimizes data fetching and page rendering.

## Setup
1. Inside the root folder run `npm install`.
2. To get the backend running, navigate into the `/backend` sub folder and execute `npm install` there as well.
3. To run the application in development mode, simply navigate into the root folder and run `npm run dev`.

## Used technologies
- NextJS
- Data and Request Caching
- Request Memoization
- SQL

## Todos
- [ ] Delete inline styles that were just assigned for demo purposes.
- [ ] Remove CSS element selectors and replace them with classes.
